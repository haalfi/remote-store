# Development Backlog

Active work items and ideas. Completed items live in
[BACKLOG-DONE.md](BACKLOG-DONE.md).

Items graduate through the SDD pipeline:
**Idea → Backlog → RFC/Spec → Tests → Code**.

## How this file works

**Status legend:** `[ ]` pending · `[~]` in progress

**Ordering:** newest first within each section.

**Completing work:**

- Fully done → delete from here, add to `BACKLOG-DONE.md` as `[x]`
  (same commit as the code change).
- Partially done → split: ship the done part to `BACKLOG-DONE.md` as `[x]`
  under its original ID, create a new ID here for the remaining work, and
  link both.

**ID prefixes:**

| Prefix | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `BL-NNN` | Release blocker — must resolve before next PyPI publish. |
| `BK-NNN` | Committed backlog work, queued behind blockers. |
| `BUG-NNN` | Confirmed defect with reproduction steps. |
| `ID-NNN` | Idea — not evaluated, not committed to. |

## Bugs

- [ ] **BUG-147 — SFTP `delete_folder` masks `listdir` permission errors**
  Non-recursive `delete_folder` catches bare `OSError` from `listdir` and
  defaults to `entries = []` (line 437). A permission-denied error is silently
  swallowed; the code then calls `rmdir` on a non-empty folder, producing a
  misleading error. Should distinguish ENOENT from other errno values.

- [ ] **BUG-146 — SFTP listing methods silently swallow non-ENOENT errors**
  `_list_files_depth`, `list_folders`, and `iter_children` all catch bare
  `OSError` from `listdir_attr` and return/yield nothing. Permission-denied
  or I/O errors are indistinguishable from an empty directory. Should only
  catch ENOENT; other errors should propagate as `RemoteStoreError`.

- [ ] **BUG-145 — SFTP `_ensure_parent_dirs` swallows permission errors**
  `stat` failure catches bare `OSError` (line 826), then `mkdir` failure is
  suppressed (line 827-828). A permission error at any intermediate directory
  is invisible — the caller sees only the subsequent write fail with a
  misleading error. Should check errno before attempting mkdir.

- [ ] **BUG-144 — SFTP SSH client leaked on connection failure**
  `_connect()` creates `ssh = self._create_ssh_client()` (line 680). If
  `_do_connect()` exhausts retries, the exception propagates without storing
  `ssh` in `self._ssh_client`, so `_close_clients()` never closes it. The
  `SSHClient` (socket, transport) leaks.

- [ ] **BUG-143 — SFTP `st_mode` None causes TypeError in listing/traversal**
  paramiko `SFTPAttributes` defaults `st_mode = None`. If an SFTP server omits
  file-mode flags in `listdir_attr` responses, `stat.S_ISREG(None)` raises
  `TypeError`. Affects `list_files`, `list_folders`, `iter_children`, `_rmtree`,
  and `_collect_folder_stats`.

- [ ] **BUG-142 — SFTP `read()` leaks file handle if stream wrapping fails**
  In `read()`, if `_ErrorMappingStream()` or `io.BufferedReader()` construction
  raises, the paramiko file handle `f` (line 302) is never closed. Should wrap
  in try/except to close `f` on failure.

## Ideas

### API Surface Enhancements

- [ ] **ID-123 — Cache key derivation from `ResolutionPlan` (Phase 2)**
  `ext.cache` derives cache keys from `ResolutionPlan` fields instead of
  ad-hoc `(operation, path)` tuples. Only valuable once `CompositeStore`
  (ID-121) exists — single-backend cache keys are already correct.
  - Spec: RES-100 (proposed in [043](specs/043-resolution-plan.md))
  - Depends on: ID-121 (CompositeStore)

### New Backends

- [ ] **ID-121 — CompositeStore (research complete)**
  `CompositeStore(Store)` — core Store subclass (not extension) that composes
  multiple stores into one. Deterministic fallthrough resolution for reads, union
  LIST (deduplicated), writes to primary tier only.
  - [Research](research/research-sqlalchemy-backend.md#52-compositestore-id-120)
    (anchor uses historical ID-120 from research doc; now ID-121 after swap)
  - Depends on: unified `resolve()` → `ResolutionPlan` (ID-120); at least two
    working backends to be useful; pairs well with ID-119
  - Next: design as separate spec — backend-agnostic, useful independently

### Integrations

- [~] **ID-018 — conda-forge publishing**
  Recipe, CI validation, release checklist steps all done.
  - Done: [recipe](../packaging/conda-forge/recipe.yaml),
    [conda-recipe workflow](../.github/workflows/conda-recipe.yml),
    staged-recipes PR `conda-forge/staged-recipes#32401` (CI green).
  - Blocked: waiting for conda-forge reviewer approval. When merged: add
    `conda install -c conda-forge remote-store` to README.

- [~] **ID-013b — Async Store API Phase 3: async extensions**
  Remainder of ID-013. Phase 1 (core primitives) and Phase 2 (native async
  backends) shipped — see [BACKLOG-DONE.md](BACKLOG-DONE.md).
  Spec 029 amended with round 2 §2.4 items + Phase 2 AsyncAzureBackend spec.
  Async guide updated with native backend docs.
  - Remaining:
    - Implementation Phase 3: async extensions. Note: Dagster 1.12.21 has no
      `AsyncIOManager`; `UPathIOManager.load_partitions_async` is internal only.
      Blocked until Dagster exposes a public async IO manager interface.

## Icebox

Deferred indefinitely — revisit only if demand or circumstances change.

- [ ] **ID-114 — PyArrow-style bucket path support (research)**
  PyArrow convention: `"bucket/prefix"` embeds bucket in path. Current
  `S3Backend` requires split (`bucket=...`, `path=...`). Research feasibility
  of factory method or native convention for easier PyArrow→remote-store
  migration.
  - Deliverable: RFC only — low commitment, no code change guaranteed

- [ ] **ID-118b — TLS CA bundle for Azure (Phase 2)**
  Extend `tls_ca_bundle` to `AzureBackend` if demand materializes.
  Primarily benefits Azure Stack Hub / on-premises deployments.
  Wrap `ClientOptions(ca_cert=...)`, check `AZURE_CA_CERTIFICATE_PATH`.
  S3 Phase 1 shipped — see BACKLOG-DONE.md.

- [ ] **ID-105 — AzurePyArrowBackend (C++ Tier 1)**
  Optional upgrade from the Tier 3 range reader shipped in
  [ID-102](BACKLOG-DONE.md#streaming--io). Only worth pursuing if real-Azure
  benchmarks show GIL overhead or missing I/O coalescing matters for target
  workloads. Approach: `pyarrow.fs.AzureFileSystem` (C++, ships with PyArrow)
  following the `S3PyArrowBackend` dual-library pattern.
  [Research § 6](research/research-azure-pyarrow-optimization.md#6-full-tier-1-path-if-needed).
  - Spike: validate auth methods, HNS/non-HNS, `ReadRangeCache` activation.
  - If viable: `AzurePyArrowBackend` — spec, tests, docs.

- [ ] **ID-125 — Update medallion showcase to Dagster v2 resource pattern**
  Replace `dagster_io_manager(store)` calls in `examples/medallion_dagster/`
  with `RemoteStoreIOManager`. Demonstrates the config-driven pattern.

- [ ] **ID-066 — PR preview deployments**
  Deploy PR previews to Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, or GitHub Pages artifacts.
  Inspired by FastAPI's Cloudflare Pages pattern. Infrastructure decision needed.
  [Research](research/research-fastapi-docs.md) P6.

- [ ] **ID-067 — griffe-typingdoc for `Annotated[T, Doc("...")]` docstrings**
  Only relevant if migrating from Google-style docstrings to PEP 727
  `Annotated[T, Doc("...")]`. Not recommended near-term.
  [Research](research/research-fastapi-docs.md) P5.
